                Van Rossum was born and raised in Netherlands, where he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. <br>
                <p>
                    He lives in Belmont, California, with his family.

                While working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, he contributed to BSD Unix in 1986 and hhelped devellop the ABC Programming laungage. He also created a web browser named Grail written in Python. <br>
                <p>
                    He has worked for various research institutes, including the CWI in Netherlands, the U.S. NIST, and the CNRI. From 2000-2003 he worked for Zope, where he created a coustom programming laungage for the organisation. From 2005 December to 2012, he worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python laungage. In January 2013, he started working for Dropbox. in October 2019 Van Rossam officially retired.

                <strong>Python:</strong>
                In December 1989, Van Rossam had been looking for a "hobby's programming project that would keep him occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a new scripting laungage: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/c hackers, which he named Python.
